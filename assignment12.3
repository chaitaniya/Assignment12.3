Q.1What is meant by FlumeNG ?
Ans.
a)Apache Flume is a distributed, reliable, and available system for efficiently collecting, aggregating and
moving large amounts of log data from many different sources to a centralized data store.
b) Flume NG is work related to new major revision of Flume and is the subject of this post.
c)At the time of writing this post Flume NG had gone through two internal milestones – NG Alpha 1, 
and NG Alpha 2 and a formal incubatorrelease of Flume NG is in the works.
d)At a high-level, Flume NG uses a single-hop message delivery guarantee semantics to provide end-to-end
reliability for the system. To accomplish this, certain new concepts have been incorporated into its design,
while certain other existing concepts have been either redefined, reused or dropped completely.

Q.2Can Flume provides 100 % reliability to the data flow?
Ans)
Yes,it provides end-to-end reliability to the flow.By default Flume uses a transactional 
approach in the data flow.Sources and sinks encapsulated in a transactional repository 
provides by the channels.These channels responsible to pass reliably from end-to-end
in 2th flow.so it provides 100% reliability to the data flow.

Q.3Can Flume can distributes data to multiple destinations?
Yes,it supports multiplexing flow.The event flows from one sources to multiple channels and multiple destinations
It's achieved by defining a flow multiplexer.Data flows are replicated to HDFS and another
sink to destination and another destination is input to another agent.

Q.4 Explain about the different channel types in Flume. And which channel type is
faster?
Ans.The 3 different built in channel types available in Flume are-

MEMORY Channel – Events are read from the source into memory and passed to the sink.

JDBC Channel – JDBC Channel stores the events in an embedded Derby database.

FILE Channel –File Channel writes the contents to a file on the file system after reading the event from a source.
The file is deleted only  after the contents are successfully delivered to the sink.

MEMORY Channel is the fastest channel among the three however has the risk of data loss. 
The channel that you choose completely depends on the nature of the big data application and the value of each event.
